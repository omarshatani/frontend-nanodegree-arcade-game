# Arcade Game Project

**Arcade Game** is a interactive HTML5 & JavaScript game.

## Game description

In this game the player objective is to get the highest score by collecting Gems and reaching higher levels.
But it won't be easy: there'll be some enemies on the road that you'll have to dodge!
The enemies will become faster as the player wins the levels.

## Game Over

If the player collides with the enemies 3 times, it'll lose all of his hearts and die. 
The player then can decide to start a new Game by hitting the **RETRY** button.

## Scoring Points

The player can score points by:

 1. Reaching the sea: **300 points**
 2. Collect a gem: **200 points**

The score will be reset to 0 if the player dies.

## How to move the character

The player character can move using the arrow keys (←, →, ↓, ↑).

## Game load

The game needs the [app](js/app.js), [engine](js/engine.js) and [resources](js/resources.js) files to load correctly.
